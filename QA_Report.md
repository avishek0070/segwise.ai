### Prioritization

**Worst UX inconsistency (highest priority):** Unlabeled chart gap (#4)

1. **Unlabeled chart gap** (#4) — breaks data interpretation, highest friction
2. **Number-formatting** (#3) — impedes rapid comparison across cards
3. **Nav-icon color clash** (#2) — draws distracting attention
4. **Non-clickable logo** (#1) — mild annoyance but easily fixed

# UX Audit Summary

## 1. Non-clickable logo
<img width="1508" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-09 at 08 35 12" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e35d814-4f89-4f3f-98d5-4e2fcdff0ed1" />



* **Issue:** The brand logo in the top-left isn’t a clickable "home" link.
* **Impact:** Users expect the logo to take them back to dashboard or home. Lacking that breaks a common navigation convention.
* **Recommendation:** Make the logo a link to the primary landing page (dashboard/home).

## 2. Nav‑icon color clash

* **Issue:** One nav icon uses bright green, while the rest are monochrome.
* **Impact:** That lone splash of color draws unintended attention and feels visually out of place.
* **Recommendation:** Either tint that icon to match the others, or introduce a consistent accent color across all active icons.

## 3. Number‑formatting inconsistencies

<img width="1512" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-09 at 08 14 43" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19711bc7-8e5c-4425-a4e4-202ebf698aa3" />


* **Issue A:** Cost‑Per‑Conversion decimals vary (sometimes two places, sometimes one).
* **Issue B:** “K” suffix appears on some spend values but not others of similar magnitude.
* **Impact:** Forces users into mental math to compare values, slows down quick scannability.
* **Recommendation:**

  * Always show two decimal places (`$0.60`, not `$0.6`).
  * Define a clear “when to abbreviate” rule (e.g. “≥1,000 → K; otherwise show full number”), and apply it uniformly.

## 4. Unlabeled chart gap

<img width="1512" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-09 at 08 25 01" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f11d076f-99c3-483c-a2b5-01f221df4777" />

* **Issue:** The empty space splitting the two date ranges in the line chart has no axis break marker or segment label.
* **Impact:** Users assume a continuous timeline and get confused—“Did data fail to load? Are these the same scale?”—breaking their flow and costing time.
* **Recommendation:**

  * Insert a vertical “break” indicator (zig-zag or dashed line).
  * Label each segment ("Primary: Dec 5–17" vs. "Compare: Dec 19–31").




# 5. “v” vs. “vs.” inconsistency
<img width="947" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-09 at 10 04 46" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c70d1890-f09b-4c81-8e06-d53746cf8d5b" />



1. **Issue:** The report selector uses a lone “v” (“Previous 7 Days v 15 Oct”) instead of the more familiar “vs.” used elsewhere.
2. **Impact:** Users must pause to decode “v” as “versus,” disrupting quick comprehension of the comparison.
3. **Recommendation:** Standardize on a single separator (e.g., always use “vs.”) across all date-range and metric comparisons.

# 6. Overly verbose campaign explanation cards
<img width="1411" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-09 at 10 10 12" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90ac8be3-5394-43fc-86a8-fcfe56c7ffcf" />


1. **Issue:** Each campaign row’s narrative is a long, run-on sentence with nested parentheses and mixed highlight colors.
2. **Impact:** Forces users to read slowly and mentally unpack the structure rather than scanning for key drivers.
3. **Recommendation:** Simplify into a consistent bullet-template (e.g., “Spends ↑60.23%, D7 ROAS ↓40.44%, key driver: D7 Retention −17.03%”).


# 7. Misplaced “Show Chart” toggle

<img width="663" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-09 at 10 18 22" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7716541-1388-40a6-b8f2-1945a2a90059" />

**Top 5 Top 10 Custom**

1. **Issue:** The “Show Chart” toggle is located in the table controls area (below the graph) but actually shows/hides the **chart** above.
2. **Impact:** Users expect that toggles placed near a UI element will control that element. Placing a chart toggle next to table controls breaks that expectation and makes it hard to discover how to hide the graph.
3. **Recommendation:** Move the “Show Chart” toggle next to the graph’s header or change its label to “Hide Chart” when the chart is visible, ensuring placement and labeling match the controlled element.

## 2. Regression Checklist

Below are the two core regression checklists you can reference for exhaustive testing of the dashboard’s Filters & Boards and Custom Reports functionality:

---

### 📑 Filters & Boards  
**Description:** Covers all interactions with the Filters panel, data granularity, chart/table toggles, and empty-state handling.  
🔗 [View the full checklist → RegressionFiltersAndBoards.md](https://github.com/avishek0070/segwise.ai/blob/main/RegressionFiltersAndBoards.md)

---

### 📊 Custom Reports  
**Description:** Validates static vs. rolling date ranges, compare-to-period overlays, AND/OR filter logic, and empty-state messaging in custom report views.
